This is Liquid, the theme by Daniel M. Duley a.k.a Mosfet, released with a few modifications:

A rewritten kwin engine that works on KDE 3.2.x (Tried porting it but the kwin engine badly needed an update)
The kcm module is depreciated in favor of the KStyle Config
Transparency shifted to the kstyle server. (Yes, XRender works now)
Misc : Fix of a few quirks in the widget engine

Credits :
Mosfet for the underlying code
Thomas Lübking for a lot of help
David Johnson for the example window decoration
