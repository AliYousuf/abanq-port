This is the Reinhardt style.                                         Version 0.7

 It is based very heavily on clee's dotNET style. It will eventually be an
interpretation of Fop's mockups as seen on kde-look.org and the Slicker
homepage. It is a proposal for the default Slicker widget style.

 To install the style, do as follows:

 $ ./configure
 $ make
 # sudo make install

 It should now be available in the KDE Control Centre Style panel.
 NB! You might very easily need to stick a --prefix=/usr or --prefix=/opt/kde3
at the end of the ./configure command. Which depends on the result of running
kde-config --prefix

 Should you wish to turn off the drop-shadow effect on text items, this is done
by adding the line "UseTextShadows=false" to the file "~/.qt/kstylerc". This can
for example be because your laptop screen makes it look fuzzy and unreadable, or
simply because you don't like it. We of course hope that the KDE team makes it
possible to to per-style setup so you won't have to edit a text file to do this.
 If you wish to turn the drop shadows off, do as above, but the option to add is
"UseDropShadows=false". This is not so much a usability issue, more that some
people seem to dislike it, so here ya go! :) Also, more drop shadows will be
appearing soon due to consistency, so there may be more reason to do so later...

On the name:
  Ad Reinhardt, 1913-1967
  Reinhardt was an American minimalist painter, who became known for his extreme
style, which also became more and more reductive from the mid 1950s, towards his
death in 1967. After 1955 he worked almost exclusively in near-black. This said,
there is in fact colour in the paintings, for example his "Abstract Painting no.
5", 1962, which can be found at the Tate Modern ( www.tate.co.uk ), is, though
seemingly black-blue, in fact squared with blue and red.

  Enjoy!
