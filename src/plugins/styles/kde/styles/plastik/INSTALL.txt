***PRE-REQUISITES

Make sure you have setup the following variables correctly:

QTDIR, QMAKESPEC, LIB, INCLUDE and PATH

You also need to have the KDEFX library source handy and the 
KDELITE source if the style supports a configuration tool
(indicated by the config directory).

Edit the "style.conf" file to change the path of the libraries
(if needed) and/or to enable the KDEFX library to be built in
the style or as DLLs (consider building KDEFX as DLL if you
going to run loads of different style on the same machine.).
If you choose to enable the KDEFX as DLL you will need to
build KDEFX prior to build the style, refer to the INSTALL
file in "kdefx" folder. 

By default the KDEFX will be built in the style DLL.

***BUILDING THE STYLE

Open a command prompt and do:

qmake 
nmake (MSVC) or make (MinGW)

Styles DLLs are installed in $(QTDIR)\plugins\styles and in the
"lib" folder

***DEPLOYEMENT

In order to deploy the style with your applications you need to
put the style DLL into a folder called "styles" located at the
root of you application. 

If you have built the style with KDEFX as DLLs you also need the
kdefx.dll in the same folder as your application. 

E.g. if you app is called "myapp.exe" and located in "c:\apps"
then here's what you should get:

c:\apps\myapp.exe
c:\apps\styles\mystyle.dll

c:\apps\kdefx.dll (opt)
